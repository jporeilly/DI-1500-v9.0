============================================================================= 
Simba JDBC Driver with SQL Connector for Google BigQuery Release Notes 
============================================================================= 

The release notes provide details of enhancements, features, and known issues 
in Simba JDBC Driver for Google BigQuery 1.2.1, as well as the version 
history. 


1.2.1 ========================================================================

Released 2019-05-15

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBQJ-291] Updated Google Cloud BigQuery Storage API
 
   The driver has been updated to use version 0.85 of the Google Cloud 
   BigQuery Storage API.


Known Issues
The following are known issues that you may encounter due to limitations in
the data source, the driver, or an application.

 * TRACE level logs incorrectly contain stack trace for function entrances.

   When logging at the TRACE level (LogLevel=6), function entrance logs are 
   generated for each function that is called. These logs incorrectly 
   include a stack trace.

 * Query prefixes are not supported.

   The driver does not support query prefixes. To specify whether your query
   statements are to be processed using standard SQL or legacy BigQuery SQL, 
   you must configure the QueryDialect connection property. 

   By default, QueryDialect is set to "SQL" so that the driver uses standard
   SQL syntax. To use BigQuery SQL instead, set the property to "BIG_QUERY".

 * Support for ODBC Escape Sequences is limited.

   The only supported ODBC Escape Sequences are Scalar Functions of the form 
   {fn func(args)} if func is supported by the Google BigQuery data source 
   engine. 

 * When casting data, you must specify the data type according to Google 
   BigQuery standards.

   When casting data to a specific data type, you must use the corresponding 
   data type name shown in the "Casting" section of the Query Reference:
   https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/functions-and-operators#casting. 

   For example, to cast the "salary" column to the INTEGER type, you must 
   specify INT64 instead of INTEGER: 

      SELECT position, CAST(salary AS INT64) from Employee


Version History ==============================================================

1.2.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released 2019-03-01

Enhancements & New Features 

 * [GBJQ-269] Support for the BigQuery Storage API

   The driver can now use BigQuery Storage API to more efficiently process
   large result sets. For more information, see the Installation and 
   Configuration Guide.

 * [GBQJ-273] Updated OAuth URLs
 
   The URLs used by the driver for OAuth authentication have been updated
   to remain current.


Resolved Issues
The following issues WERE resolved in Simba JDBC Driver for Google BigQuery 
1.2.0. 

 * [GBQJ-284] In some cases, when executing a query that takes a long time 
   to complete, the query fails and the driver returns a GeneralException 
   error.
   
   This issue has been resolved. The driver now returns a more informative
   error message if a long-running query times out.

 * [GBQJ-274] In some cases, the driver cannot retrieve arrays with primitive
   types.
